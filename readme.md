# Where's the beef?

#### Beef consumption web map

---

This project aims to evaluate the geographic variation in beef consumption in 2021.

County population vaccine percentage data were downloaded from [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm), thus the data are limited to countries that are members of OECD. It was the only meat consumption data I could find that was free to download.

The web map was made primarily with Leaflet, and jQuery. The map legend was made in a layout page in ArcPro.

The countries with the lowest beef consumption are white, while the countries with the highest beef consumption are dark red.
